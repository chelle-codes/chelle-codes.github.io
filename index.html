  <h1>Hello World! </h1>
  <p>I'm an aspiring full stack web developer. This is my website. It's a work-in-progress,
  so for more details the best place you can find them right now is my LinkedIn: <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/yourname">LinkedIn</a>. Too much too read right now? Here's the gist: I love tinkering 
    around online since Myspace editing days (anyone remember those?) I'm working on my Bachelors in Software Development and enjoy learning new tech skills as often as I can. 
    I also enjoy concerts, cooking, taking walks in nature, and poetry. </p>
